## Description

In this challenge, I was asked to analyze code that came from Pymaceuticals, Inc. The dataset reflects 249 mice that have squamous cell carcinoma tumors treated with anti-tumor regimens over the course of 45 days. The scientists wanted to see what the data from this study revealed concerning the drug treatmentâ€™s effectiveness, specifically related to a drug called Capomulin. To accomplish this analysis, I utilized my Mac OS, Python Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, and GitHub.


## Table of Contents

Code for analysis found in the 'Pymaceuticals_kirbysmith.ipynb' file within the 'Pymaceuticals' directory. Data for analysis was pulled from the 'mouse_metadata.csv' and 'study_results.csv' files within the 'Pymaceuticals' directory. Report about the analysis is contained in the "Report.txt' file.

## Installation Instructions

Code utilized for this challenge can be found in the files titled "Pymaceuticals_kirbysmith.ipynb" within the matplotlib-challenge directory on my github "matplotlib_challenge" repo.

## Usage

Can Git Clone all files from my matplotlib-challenge repo.


## Credits

For this challenge I utilized the ASK BCS feature on Slack, Google, ChatGPT, fellow students, YouTube, Stack Overflow, TA assistance, Bootcamp tutor assistance, and educational resources related to the unit provided by the bootcamp.
