In this challenge, I was asked to analyze code that came from Pymaceuticals, Inc. The dataset reflects 249 mice that have squamous cell carcinoma tumors treated with anti-tumor regimens over the course of 45 days. The scientists wanted to see what the data from this study revealed concerning the drug treatment’s effectiveness, specifically related to a drug called Capomulin. The number of mice studied in total was 249. There was one duplicate Mouse ID in the study, "g989", which was subsequently dropped from the data set when the data was cleaned. This cleaning left the data set with a total of 248 mice ID's to be analyzed. 
The Capomulin drug regimen had a mean tumor volume of 40.675, median tumor volume of 41.557, and a tumor volume standard deviation of 4.994. On the bar graphs the Capomulin visually indicated it had the highest number of observed mouse timepoints, followed closely by Ramicane. 
The mice studied consisted of 51% male and 49% female mice. In the plotting the line graph for a specific mouse who was treated with Capomulin, “mouse I509”, it was revealed that generally the more days that passed, the smaller the tumor volume number became. 
The scatter plot generally indicated that the more the mice weighed, the larger the tumors were. The correlation coefficient between the mice weight and average tumor volume was 0.84. The linear regression was R-squared = 0.71.
Based on the data, Capomulin is the best choice for tumor reduction when compared to the other treatment regimens in the study.
